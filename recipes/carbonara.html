        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a faster, and less expensive lasagna.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) package spaghetti</li>
            <li> teaspoons olive oil<li>
            <li>1 (4 ounce) package pancetta bacon, diced</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>2 ½ cups whipping cream</li>
            <li>1 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>8 large egg yolks</li>
            <li>¼ cup chopped fresh basil</li>
            <li>¼ cup chopped fresh Italian parsley</li>
            <li>4 cups shredded cooked chicken</li>
            <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, heat olive oil in a large, heavy frying pan over medium heat. Add pancetta and garlic; saute until brown and crisp, about 8 minutes. Remove from the heat and cool slightly.</li>
            <li>Whisk cream, Parmesan, egg yolks, basil, and parsley together in a large bowl until well blended.</li>
            <li>Stir chicken into the pancetta mixture until combined. Add cooked spaghetti and cream mixture. Toss over medium-low heat until chicken is heated through and sauce forms a thick coating over the spaghetti, about 4 minutes. Do not boil or the eggs will scramble. Season with salt and pepper and transfer to a large, wide serving bowl.</li>
        </ol>
